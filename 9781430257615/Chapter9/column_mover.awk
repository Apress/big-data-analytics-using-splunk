# Move column 6 and 30 to be the new column 1 and 2

# Define input and output field separators as comma

BEGIN {
   FS = ",";
   OFS = ","
}

# OriginCityName and DestCityName include the state separated by a comma, so it really is column 32 instead of 30
# This exception does not work for the title line, so process differently
